Frontend Developer
------------------

In 2018, I earned a Bachelor of Science (BS) in Information Technologies. I loved my time in this program because it encouraged combining tech, business acumen and people skills. Throughout the program there was an emphasis on problem-solving and managing crisis for organizations large and small. After college, I felt prepared for any challenge. I chose to freelance. It allowed the greatest flexibility of my time. And let me truly separate work from family responsibilities. Freelancing also strengthened the problem-solving skills gained from college. You're client has to be happy with the complete website. So as a freelancer that caused me to learn digital creation, some animation, copywriting, SEO, and gain experience working with various platforms. But change is inevitable and now, I'm ready and able to pursue working in other ways.
